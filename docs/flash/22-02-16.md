# Ratatouille - 美食总动员

Critic Ego :

In many ways, the work of a critic is easy. We risk very little, yet enjoy a position over those who offer up their work and their selves to our judgement. We thrive on negative criticism, which is fun to write and to read. But the bitter truth we critics must face is that in the grand scheme of things, the average piece of junk is probably more meaningful than our criticism designating it so. But there are times when a critic truly risks something and that is in the discovery and defense of the way.

The world is often unkind to new talent, new creations. The new needs friends. Last night, I experienced something new, an extraoridinary meal from a singularly unexpected source. The say that both the meal and its maker have challenged my preconceptions about fine cooking is a gross understatement. The have rocked me to my core. 

In the past, I have made no secret of my disdain for Chef Gusteau's famous motto, 'Anyone can cook.'. But I realize only now do I truly understand what he meant. Not everyone can become a great artist, but a great artist can come from anywhere. It is difficult to imagine more humble origins than those of the genius now cooking at Gusteau's, who is, in this critic's opinion, nothing less than the finest chef in France. 

I will be returning to Gusteau's soon, hungry for more.


就许多方面来说，评论家的工作很轻松。我们冒的风险很小，却握有无比的权力。人们必须奉上自己和作品，供我们评论。我们喜欢吹毛求疵，因为读写皆饶富趣味。但我们评论家得面对难堪的事实，就是以价值而言，我们的评论，可能根本比不上我们大肆批评的平庸事物。可是 ，有时评论家必须冒险，去发掘并捍卫新的事物。

这世界常苛刻的对待新秀、新创作。新事物需要人的支持。昨晚，我有个全新的体验：一顿奇妙的菜肴，来自令人意想不到的出处！如果说这顿菜肴和它的创作者，挑战了我对美食先入为主的观念。然而这么说还太含蓄了，他们彻底的震撼了我。

过去我曾公开呛声对食神的名言: "料理非难事" 嗤之以鼻!不过我发现，直到现在我终于真正了解了他的意思。**并非是谁都能成为，伟大的艺术家，不过伟大的艺术家却可能来自任何角落。**现今在食神餐厅掌厨的天才，出身之低微，令人难以想像。但依个人的看法，他是法国最优秀的厨师。

我很快会再度光临食神餐厅! 满足我的口腹之欲
